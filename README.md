**Syndeo** allows developers to build portable **Ray Clusters** with **secure containerization**.  With Syndeo, developers can write their code using Ray and deploy it to on-premesis SLURM computing or off-premesis cloud computing without changing code.  Secure containerization means that user privileges are enforced and code deployed from Syndeo can operate on multi-tenant systems.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
These are some variables that should be set prior to running the tests.

```bash
# Ensure that you are using local python packages
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=True
```

In order to run this program you will need to create a custom environment.  This assumes you are using Anaconda:

```bash
conda create -n syndeo python=3.10
conda activate syndeo
pip install poetry # should use versions >=1.4.2
poetry install # add --with=dev if you want developer tests
```

If you would rather use the pip installer executing the following instead:

```console
pip install .
```



# üìî Usage
To see the CLI options enter:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

To set up a Ray cluster with all defaults and run you can issue the following commands:

```bash
python main.py setup-head   # setup a node
python main.py setup-cpu    # setup a worker node
python main.py show         # show the configuration
python main.py run          # run the configuration
```

    </p>
</figure>

If you need further help on the different commands you can invoke help via:

```bash
python main.py setup-head --help
```



If you want to have an alias with auto-completion invoke the following:
```bash
python main.py --install-completion
```

Afterwards you can invoke the commands using `syndeo`:
```bash
syndeo --help       # autocompletion included
syndeo setup_head   # autocompletion included
syndeo setup_cpu    # autocompletion included
```
