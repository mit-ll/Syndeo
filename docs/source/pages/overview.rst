**Syndeo** allows developers to build portable **Ray Clusters** with **secure containerization**.  With Syndeo, developers can write their code using Ray and deploy it to on-premesis SLURM computing or off-premesis cloud computing without changing code.  Secure containerization means that user privileges are enforced and code deployed from Syndeo can operate on multi-tenant systems.

Syndeo leverages containers to host Ray and all of your applications together.  These containers can then be deployed to SLURM or a cloud provider of your choosing.

Once the Ray Cluster is established, jobs can be directly sent to the Ray head node for processing.
