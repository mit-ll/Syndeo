ðŸ“„ Documentation
================

This repository contains two types of auto-documentation:

* [**Sphinx**](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A **powerful** documentation framework that allows users to create *beautiful* web-based layouts.

[Sphinx Book Theme](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides beautiful documentation based on the [Edward Tufte's](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) design principals.  Sphinx is considered the gold standard in documentation but requires a lot of up-front investment.  If you are building a bigger project, this is the recommended framework to use.
